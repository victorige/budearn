<p>You are under no obligation to provide any such information. However, if you should choose to withhold requested information, we may not be able to provide you with any services available on or through the BudEarn Site and Features (the “Services”). When you visit or use the BudEarn Site, we may, by means of cookies and/or other similar technologies, automatically collect additional information about you – such as the type of internet browser or mobile device you use, any website from which you have come to the BudEarn Site, your IP address (the unique address which identifies your computer or mobile device on the internet) and/or the operating system of your computer or mobile device. See Cookies and other technologies for more information.</p>

<h3>Location data</h3>


<p>We may collect information through the BudEarn Site and Features as to your real time geo-location to provide location services where requested or agreed to by you in order to deliver content, advertising or other services that are dependent on knowing where you are. This information may also be collected in combination with an identifier associated with your device to enable us to recognise your mobile browser or device when you return to the BudEarn Site and Features. We may share your location information with our advertisers, merchant and survey partners or other in order to provide you with advertising, content, surveys, offers, Promotions and Rewards Programs, or for other marketing, administrative and general business purposes such as attribution, analytics and research. You may opt out at any time from allowing further access by us to your location data by adjusting the settings on your mobile device or by following the instructions available on our BudEarn Sites and Features. You can also stop all location data collection by un-installing the mobile app, using the standard un-install processes for your mobile device.</p>

<h3>Cookies and other technologies</h3>


<p>When you interact with the BudEarn Site and Features, we try to make that experience simple and meaningful. When you visit the BudEarn Site, a web server sends a cookie or other similar technology to your computer or mobile device (as the case may be).  Cookies are small pieces of information which are issued to your computer or mobile device when you visit a website or access or use a mobile application and which store and sometimes track information. Some cookies we use may last only for the duration of your web or application session and expire when you close your browser or exit the BudEarn Site. Other cookies are used to remember you when you return to the BudEarn Site and will last for longer. The cookies and/or other similar technologies we use collect a variety of relevant information, such as the type of internet browser or mobile device you use, any website from which you have come to the BudEarn Site, your IP address and/or the operating system of your computer or mobile device. We use cookies and/or other similar technologies, such as tracking GIFs, web beacons, pixel codes and in-app IDs, either alone or in combination with each other to create a unique device ID and to:</p>

<p>remember that you have visited us before. This means we can identify the number of unique visitors we receive. This allows us to make sure we have enough capacity for the number of users that we get;</p>
<p>customise elements of the promotional layout and/or content of the pages of the BudEarn Site;</p>
<p>collect anonymous statistical information about how you use the BudEarn Site and Features (including how long you spend on the BudEarn Site) and where you have come to the BudEarn Site from, so that we can improve the BudEarn Site and learn which parts of the BudEarn Site are most popular with users; and</p>
<p>gather information about the pages on the BudEarn Site and Features, and also other information about other websites that you visit, so as to place you in a “market segment”. This information is collected by reference to the IP address that you are using and/or your unique user ID, and includes information about the county and city you are in, together with the name of your internet service provider. This information is then used to place interest-based advertisements and content on the BudEarn Site which it is believed will be relevant to your market segment.</p>
<p>Some of the cookies used by the BudEarn Site are set by us, and some are set by third parties who are delivering services or operating features on our behalf. Most web and mobile device browsers automatically accept cookies but, if you prefer, you can change your browser to prevent that or to notify you each time a cookie is set.  You can also learn more about cookies by visiting www.allaboutcookies.org which includes additional useful information on cookies and how to block cookies using different types of browser or mobile device. Please note, however, that by blocking or deleting cookies used on the BudEarn Site, you may not be able to take full advantage of the BudEarn Site and Features including the tracking of data required for Promotions and Rewards Programs.</p>

<h3>Information sharing</h3>


<p>We may disclose aggregate statistics about users of the BudEarn Site in order to describe our business and Services to prospective partners, advertisers, sponsors and other reputable third parties and for other lawful purposes, but these statistics will include no personally identifiable information.

Our agents and contractors will only use your information to the extent necessary to perform their functions. In the event that we undergo re-organisation or are sold to a third party, you agree that any personal information we hold about you may be transferred to that re-organised entity or third party. We may disclose your personal information if required to do so by law or if we believe that such action is necessary to prevent fraud or cyber crime or to protect the BudEarn Site and Features or the rights, property or personal safety of any person.</p>

<h3>Social Features</h3>


<p>Certain functionality on the BudEarn Site and Features may permit interactions that you initiate between the BudEarn Site and Features and a third-party website or service, such as Facebook and Twitter (“Social Features”). Examples of Social Features include enabling you to “like” or “share” content from the BudEarn Site and Features with another website or service; to log-in to the BudEarn Site and Features using your username and password for a third-party website or service; to transmit content to the BudEarn Site and Features from your account on a third-party website or service; and to otherwise connect the BudEarn Site and Features to a third-party website or service. If you choose to use Social Features, information you post or provide access to will be shared with that third-party website or service and others, and may be publicly displayed on the BudEarn Site and Features or by the provider of the Social Feature that you use. Similarly, if you post information on a third-party platform that references any of the BudEarn Site and Features (e.g., by using a hashtag associated with any of the BudEarn Site and Features in a tweet or status update), your post may be published on the BudEarn Site and Features in accordance with the terms of the third-party website or service. Also, both we and the third party may have access to certain information about you and your use of the BudEarn Site and Features and the third-party website or service. The information we collect in connection with Social Features is subject to this Privacy Policy. The information collected and stored by any third-party website or service via Social Features remains subject to the third party’s privacy practices, including whether the third party continues to share information with us, the types of information shared, and your choices with regard to what is visible to others on that third-party website or service.</p>


<h3>Child safety</h3>


<p>Protecting the safety of children when they use the Internet is important to us. The BudEarn Site and Features are intended for use only by persons who are at least 18 years of age.</p>

<h3>External links</h3>


<p>The BudEarn Site may, from time to time, contain links to merchants, market research companies, or other external sites. We are not responsible for the privacy policies or the content of such sites.</p>

<h3>Security</h3>


<p>We place great importance on the security of all personal information associated with our users. We have security measures in place to attempt to protect against the loss, misuse and alteration of personal information under our control. For example, our security and privacy policies are periodically reviewed and enhanced as necessary and only authorised personnel have access to personal information. Whilst we cannot ensure or guarantee that loss, misuse or alteration of information will never occur, we attempt to use all reasonable efforts to prevent it. You should bear in mind that submission of information over the internet is never entirely secure. We cannot guarantee the security of information you submit via the BudEarn Site and Features whilst it is in transit over the internet and any such submission is at your own risk. It is advisable to close your browser when you have finished your user session to help ensure others do not access your personal information if you use a shared computer or a computer in a public place.</p>

<h3>Storage of your information</h3>


<p>Information that you submit via the BudEarn Site and Features is sent to and stored on secure servers located in the United States of America and may be transferred by us to our other offices and/or to the third parties, who may be situated in the United States of America or elsewhere outside the EEA and may be processed by staff operating outside the EEA (see Information sharing). The US and other non-EEA countries do not have similar data protection laws to the EEA, and you should be aware in particular that the law and practice in the United States in respect of law enforcement authority access to data is significantly different from Europe.  Where we transfer your information we will take all reasonable steps to ensure that your privacy rights continue to be protected consistent with our obligations under local law. By submitting information via the website, you agree to this storing, processing and/or transfer.</p>

<h3>Your rights</h3>


<p>You have a legal right under the U.K. Data Protection Act 1998 and/or and the EU General Data Privacy Regulation (GDPR) to a copy of all the personal information about you held by us. On request, we will provide you with a copy of this information. You also have a right to correct any errors in that information. You also have the right to delete that information, but in that case we may necessarily have to close your account and your participation in any of our Rewards Programs, as we would be unable to continue to offer you our Services.</p>
